Calculate average:-
Aditya has been struggling with fever for almost a week now. In Berland, a week lasts for k days, and Aditya wants to figure 
out his average sleep time per week. He visited a doctor who asked about his sleeping schedule. Fortunately, Aditya kept 
records of his sleep times for the last n days, denoted as a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai denotes the sleeptime at the ith day.

Since the number of records is too large for Aditya to handle, he needs your help to calculate the average sleep time. 
To find the average, Aditya considers k consecutive days as a week. This means there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take 
into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3, and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is ((3+4)+(4+7))/2 = 9.
Calculate the average sleep times of Aditya over all the weeks.

Input
The first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).
The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).

Output
Output average sleeping time over all weeks.

The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.
