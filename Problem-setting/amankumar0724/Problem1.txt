n persons attended a seminar held by Sandeep Maheshwari. A binary array b of n
length represents that ith person is boosted or got more depressed. If b[i] is 
1 then the ith person is gets more motivated by 1 unit else depressed by -1. The initial motivated
and depressed condition of each ith person is represented by two arrays e and d 
respectively. e[i] and d[i] represents the initial motivated or depressed value of ith person
before seminar.
Seminar is considered to be successful if atleast k people are completely motivated.
A person is said to be completely motivated if final e'[i] > d'[i].

You have to print whether the seminar was successful or not. If successful then 
print YES else NO.

b[i] ={1,0}
,1<=t,n,e[i],d[i]<=10^5
1<=k<=n
sum of N over all the test cases will be less than or equal to 10^6

INPUT:
First line of input is t, the number of test cases.
t lines follows:
First line of each test case contains two integers n ,k
Second line of each test case contain n space separated binary number 1 or 0 i.e. b[i].
Third line of each test case contain n space separated positive integers e[i]
Fourth line of each test case contain n space separated positive integers d[i]

OUTPUT:
If seminar is successful then print YES else NO.
