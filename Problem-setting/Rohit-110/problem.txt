Everybody likes getting something for free, especially Students.
There's a popular belief that if, on the night before a test, a student opens their window, looks at their college records, and shouts "Go, good luck, go!" three times, 
the good luck they call for,  helps them pass the test.
On the night before PS exam, a group of students in a dormitory decided to give it a try. Each student performed the good luck ritual at a specific time since the night
started.
Here's the catch: the good luck is a bit unpredictable. It only stays around the dormitory for a limited time, T seconds. So, if the times at which two students 
performed the ritual are more than T seconds apart, at least one of them might not get the good luck they hoped for.

Input:
The first line of the input contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), where n — the number of students shouted "Go, good luck, go!" The second line contains n positive integers ti (1 ≤ ti ≤ 1000).

The last line contains integer T (1 ≤ T ≤ 1000) — the time interval during which the good luck was near the dormitory.

Output
Print a single integer — the maximum number of students who will pass PS exam tomorrow because of the good luck visit.
