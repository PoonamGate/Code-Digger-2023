The problem could be solved using binary search or by iterative way.
Iterative way:
Sort the array given array. 
Now,Iterate through the sorted array a.
For each element at index, increment the pointer until the time difference is greater than k.
Update Max with the maximum of its current value and the difference between the pointer and index (number of students visited).
