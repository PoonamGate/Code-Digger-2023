A Special Number can be defined to follow the given below rules:
1) If the number is single digit or double digit, it's of the form 7*n [n=0,1...,14]
2) Else, Multiply last digit of number by 2. Subtract the result from the remaining digits. Repeat step 2, until a 2 digit or 1 digit number is obtained. The obtained number satisfies rule 1.
Eg: 2604 = 260 - 8 = 252 = 25 - 4 = 21 (Satisfies Rule 1, therefore special no.)
Eg: 2605 = 260 - 10 = 250 = 25 - 0 = 25 (Doesn't satisfy Rule 1, therefore not special no.)

An array S is made of (10^7 + 14) special numbers arranged in ascending order, starting from the first 4 digit special number (s0).
You are required to create a subarray X, consisting of [s1, s2,... s(U)].
Given an integer n[i], find the number of elements in X, whose sum of digits is divisble by n[i].

Input:
First line of input consists of a single integer T, denoting no. of test cases.
Each Test case consists of,
First line containing containing integer U (denoting no. of elements in X)
Second line containing N, no. of n[i]
Third line containing N space seperated integers, denoting n[i]

Output:
For each test case, output N space seperated integers, number of elements in X, whose sum of digits is divisble by n[i].

Constraints:
1<=t<=1e5
1<=U<=1e5
1<=N<=1e3
1<=n[i]<=1e3
The sum of U*N over all test cases does not exceed 3*1e6
