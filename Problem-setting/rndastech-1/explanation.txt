The given rules are divisibility rules/checks for divisibility of a number by 7.
(Alternatively, first 6-7 si can be generated by writing test method following the rules given. It can be observed that all si are divisble by 7 and are consecutive multiples of 7)
Thus, s0 is first 4 digit number divisible by 7 (1001)
s1 = 1001 + 7
si = 1001 + (7*i)
Array is filled using for loop
Digit Sum is calculated and stored for each si
Divisibility of the digit sums is checked against each n[i] and output is generated.

Test Method:
 for(int i=1000;;i++){
            int temp =i;
            while(temp>99){
               temp = (temp/10) - (2*(temp%10));  }
            if(temp%7==0){
            cout<<i<<endl;}}
