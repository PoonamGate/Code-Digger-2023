There's only one case for every checks( rows, columns and diagonals) which fails that is three '.' in a same line. 
To tackle it in case of rows use:
        if((row)&&(grid[i][0] != '.'))
            winner = grid[i][0];
instead of
        if(row)
            winner = grid[i][0];
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(grid[i][0] != '.') will ensure if for loop passes with bool row = 1, it will ignore the mentioned case. 
Similarly for other checks too.
